### What is multicollinearity?

Multicollinearity exists when two or more predictors in a regression model are moderately or highly correlated.

### Types of multicollinearity

- **Structural multicollinearity** is a mathematical artifact caused by creating new predictors from other predictors â€” such as, creating the predictor x2 from the predictor x.
- **Data-based multicollinearity** is a result of a poorly designed experiment, reliance on purely observational data, or the inability to manipulate the system on which the data are collected.
